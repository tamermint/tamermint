## 🧱 Solidity Engineer

🔐 I build and test Ethereum smart contracts with a security-first mindset.

---

### 🎯 Focus Areas
- 🏗️ **Protocol engineering** — DeFi primitives, stablecoin mechanics, vault patterns  
- 🧪 **Testing discipline (Foundry)** — unit tests, fuzzing, invariant/property-based testing  
- 🧭 **Clean architecture** — explicit invariants, clear trust assumptions, minimal attack surface  

---

### ⭐ Featured Work
- 🪙 **Stablecoin / DeFi Protocol (Foundry)**  
  Collateralized design exploration with a heavy emphasis on invariants, edge cases, and test coverage.

- 🧾 **On-chain authenticity PoC (Repticle)**  
  Early-stage experimentation around provenance/verification; evolving toward a more Solidity-first architecture.

---

### 🧠 Engineering Principles
- 📝 **Specs before code** — invariants, threat model, failure modes  
- 🧩 **Composable modules** — avoid monolith contracts where possible  
- ✅ **Correctness > demos** — safety and clarity over hype  

---

### 🚀 Currently Improving
- 📡 Oracle safety patterns (staleness, decimals normalization, fallback logic)  
- 🧮 Vault math & rounding behaviors (ERC-4626 style mechanics)  
- 🛡️ Upgrade + permissioning safety (roles, timelocks, emergency controls)
